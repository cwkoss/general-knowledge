- Mycorrhizal fungi
  - interfaces with plant roots to store water, exchange nutrients for carbon, helps reduce disease

  - Produces [glomalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomalin), cool shit that makes soil good (tilth), up to 10%+ of soil, but only discovered in 1996!
    - extraction: 'It requires an unusual effort to dislodge glomalin for study: a bath in citrate combined with heating at 250 Â°F for at least an hour'
      - Addison says: "The "bath in citrate" is probably a bath in some relatively-neutral citrate salt (ex. sodium citrate). The idea is probably to do ion exchange. The citrate ion is relatively "soft", and likes to combine with polyvalent ions like iron. So, you probably end up with the glomalin exchanging its iron ions for sodium ions, and the citrate "picking up" the iron ions. Since iron can have +2 or +3 charge, but sodium is just +1, this helps to break up the glomalin, since it can no longer be "linked" with 2 or 3 glomalin ions clustering around a multiply-charged iron ion."

- Compost heating
  - Pain mound
  - Could maybe be used with a sterling engine to produce power
- Qs
  - How tolerant are plant roots to x-ray?  Could you rotate a potted plant and repeatedly x-ray it to generate a 3-d model of the root system in slow/real time?  What other ways could you accurately image a root system while its still in soil?  Growing next to glass pane or hydroponic would give some visibility, but a 3-d video of root growth in soil would be super cool.
