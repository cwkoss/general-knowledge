## modular houses
- Build a bunch of mobile "room" structures on wheels.  Make universal 'hallway' connectors that are easily attached between rooms with standardized doorframe attachment points. Put em out where there is lots of land.   Build room by room, and have the flexibility to easily alter both layout and implementation of each room in the future.  Totally flexible architecture has a lot of interesting possibilities.

- Building permanent structures entails a bunch of building codes and shit.  It's also scary to commit to construction because the cost of changing anything is extremely expensive. Anything that's permanently attached to a foundation has to follow a bunch of rules and there are expensive laws and regulations and bullshit.  I think by making things mobile, you can maybe avoid some regulations.   

- Some people have gotten around this by building mobile trailer houses.  If it's on wheels, it's legally a trailer and has fewer rules. Unfortunately, to actually move a mobile trailer house forces you to design within the constraints of the US road system, maximum width and height. 

- Presumably, if you had a large, flat-ish piece of land, you could make big fucking mobile trailers with smaller wheels, just good enough to move the structure hundreds of feet at feet-per-hour speeds (you can get 60-foot boat trailers, width is constrained by lane width to 8 ft 6 in). So, you build a bunch of trailer-rooms.  Bedroom-on-wheels, bathroom-on-wheels, walk-in closet and storage pod, kitchen pod, theater pod, hot tub pod, bar pod, whatever.   I think you could probably make a reasonably sturdy 500 square foot room on wheels, and who really needs a room bigger than that for much.  That's like a big ass boat trailer. 

- Wheels might be hard to get level at final destination.  Ideally, you'd pour level foundations with big-ass bolts sticking up at regular spacings, and then you could just set the room down (with these same standarized attachment points) and bolt it down and it'd be super sturdy.  Maybe you could have feet on each corner of each wheeled module (and along sides for bigger ones), and you could adjust foot depth to take weight off the wheels and accommodate non-level terrain.

- So you have a bunch of these rooms.  Each of them should have a similar doorway, and then we'll make little hallway pieces that can connect the rooms together.  Rooms don't necessarily need to be any shape in particular, just make them have these standardized doorways, connect the doorways together, and then you have a structure.  I'm kind of imagining like space colony airlock kind of aesthetic.  If we could make these hallway/airlock things flexible human sized tubes, would be super cool for varying layout, you could have rooms at unusual angles from each other, and could even move rooms while the building is connected.  Water, power, sewer is a big question here, would be cool if hallways could conduct these natively, probably v3 or later lol. 

- One nice thing about building a house like this is that if you don't like a part, you can disconnect and attach a different one.  You can have a 4 bedroom home or a 1 bedroom home and 3 cabins. Keep building better master bedrooms for yourself, and keep the old rooms to use as guest bedrooms. Construction could be performed in an indoor workshop, and on smaller pieces, which would probably make it safer, faster, and cheaper than working in the middle of an empty plot of land, constrained by other rooms/walls.

- This allows the currently location-specific non-fungible work of decorating and styling a room into a commoditizable, tradable good.  A craftsman can test out every room he builds in his own house (and attach it to his house while he's working on it!). Build an ever-growing mansion and offer any redundant rooms for sale and build better ones.  Borrow your neighbors fancy kitchen when they go out of town to cook a nice meal.  Rent a hot tub or theater or BBQ patio module for a party.  Fuck remodeling, just sell your old kitchen and buy a new one.  Keep all your stuff in one closet/office pod and move into a different house every month.  

Steps:
- Buy land in the middle of nowhere
- Build mobile bunk house
- Build workshop (this one should maybe actually be fixed to the ground)
- Build water and sewer connection
- Build kitchen and bathroom pod(s), connect them up.
- Build nice bedroom pod, bathroom pod, kitchen pod, connect all rooms - now you have a nice vacation spot for one couple, AirBnB-able
- Build another bedroom module - connect it to the kitchen pod and now you've got a 2BR house
- Keep adding pods based on whatever you think would make the space better
- Eventually, divide the house into two smaller houses once you've made redundant basic functionality. 
- Convince carpenters and contractors to live in a house w/o rent and build more modules for as a vacation (maybe with some small pay)
- Start renting out structures as vacation houses.  Could go super premium and let people customize their house for their stay. "And which kitchen would you like for your stay"
- Get enough structures to support all of our friends to chill there weekends during the summer and have sweet parties and shit while making passive income from tourists
- Get people to grow food, develop manufacturing capabilities, and make a self-sustaining colony would be cool, probably would take a few decades tho
