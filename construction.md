# Construction
- [Modular houses](modular-houses.md)
  - Build a bunch of mobile "room" structures on wheels.  Make universal 'hallway' connectors that are easily attached between rooms with standardized doorframe attachment points. Put em out where there is lots of land.   Build room by room, and have the flexibility to easily alter both layout and implementation of each room in the future.  Totally flexible architecture has a lot of interesting possibilities.
- [YakhchƒÅl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhch%C4%81l) design seems like it could also be useful for summer cooling
- [Reciprocal Frames](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=reciprocal+frame#imgrc=g5liOLpl7vu0PM:) are self-supporting structures which support themselves by virtue of each piece resting on the next.   Pretty cool, would probably be achievable with miscelaneous downed limbs not necessarily of same dimensions.
