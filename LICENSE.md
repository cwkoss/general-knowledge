All derivative works must have this license.  Even if you do not display this license on your work, it shall apply.

You can't patent this, any of the information contained, gained from the use of this, or any works derived from this, recursively ad infinitum. 

You are free to build, copy, fork, modify, sell, or do whatever else you want with this or any derivative works, recursively ad infinitum, as long as it doesn't restrict anyone else's right to do the same. 

If you make a derivative work, you should make a good faith effort in making as much information about it as possible readily available for free. 

If you make a derivative work, try to let me know.  Could be cool to see what you did. (add your name and contact when you copy this license)

If you make money from a derivative work, it would be nice if you gave me some, but you don't have to.

I provide no warranty and am not liable for what you do with the information or resulting works.  I am not expert, you will die, bad stuff will happen, be careful and use common sense. Perform your own risk analysis.
