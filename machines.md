- Rostock-style cnc gardener on telephone poles erected in each corner of triangular field.  Motor at base of each pole reels in a rope which goes up the pole, over a pulley and down to the cnc head.  Likely need a separate data/power tether as well.
  - Could have hot-swappable heads to reduce weight.
  - Probably doesn't ever need to go to max pole height, but seems like pulling the cnc head 'taut' in the center at max height may require a lot of force.
  - Should probably have a section of the field reserved for storing the cnc heads and consumables such as compost or water.
  - Could run easy experiments on plants: cnc can easily and precisely vary the amounts of inputs and work on a per-plant level.
  - Qs
    - what kind of loads would be required to hold an ex. 50 lb cnc head at any position from -1 to 10 feet from ground surface?
    - to what extent does the length of the poles effect this?
- 3D rostock-style crane system
  - 3 poles, with pulleys going down to hand winches. with proper gearing and strong materials, an average person could slowly but easily manipulate heavy objects to any point in the contained 3d space.  Motors optional, but probably a good idea.  May want a block and tackle and large lever on the reel/gearing on motor.
  - similar to rostock gardener, but remove the electronics and maybe power. 
- chop-and-dropper
  - handheld weedwhacker (shorter and lighter ideally) which rotates the 'blade' perpenditular to the shaft and allowing thrusting or swiping motions to be used to prune plants/bushes/trees.  Ideally, it should cut the target in the smallest pieces possible for fast soil digestion, so should maybe have a thin metal (instead of thick plastic) blade, at a high rpm. kinda dangerous.
- refrigeration batteries
  - zeolite packages with standard connections so they can be either 
    - heated to drive off moisture, charging them up. (may not need connection for this step, might need vacuum)
    - connected to tank of water (possibly under vacuum), causing evaporative cooling
  - these systems already exist, but key question is whether the location of the endothermic phase can be separated from the exothermic phase and modularized, so 'coldness' can be stored almost as a commodity.
  - can zeolite be substituted (or mixed) with other absorbents? silica gel?
- plow plane
  - for flattening small hills or mounds on a trail or road
  - a 4 wheeled trailer that can be pulled behind a vehicle.  in between the two sets of wheels, a 'chisel' is suspended at an ~ 45 degree angle.  
  - When the trailer goes over a hill, if height of the surface between the two pairs of wheels is enough to reach the chisel, a portion of the soil will be shaved off.  A high-set chisel will only contact the most steep mounds, as it is lowered it should be able to catch shallower curves.  
  - Possibly (much like a hand plane) the chisel could just be a thick flat sheet of metal, (sharpened?).  Height of chisel can be adjusted, should probably be set a few inches above the ground when the trailer is on a flat surface, and adjusted down as catches less material.
  - As this chisel is probably going to take a lot of abuse, measures may be needed such as a blunt tip, smaller width, pointed tongs rather than a flat blade.  Hitting rocks is going to be rough, shock absorbtion on the trailer hitch and chisel fixture may be necessary.
  - Soil will be accumulated on top of a solid blade (need an ejection mechanism), or it could immediately be dropped by a blade with relief holes or tongs.  I think several ~4-6 inch holes ~6-12 inches up from the blade edge could work well.
  - Slowly is probably the best bet.  But, as the chisel will only contact the steepest parts of a hill, one could (with lots of shock absorbsion) drive fast over hills with the chisel set high to store momentum in the weight of the trailer and release it all into the high points at the moment of contact. A stretchy tow line is probably a good idea.  Could be useful for highly compacted soils, maybe even some rocks if you can get enough momentum and strength in the trailer and chisel.
- Turntable carve-by-light pantograph
  - two turntables are rotationally locked.  The model is placed on front table, medium (block of wood/clay) on the back
  - a light is placed in front of the model. based on the spacing of the light to model, you can adjust the height of the shadow on medium.
  - remove the pieces of the medium that have light on them. Once no more light can be seen, rotate the turntable and repeat.
  - this cannot accomodate concavities, but rough shapes of many object may be able to be copied.
- curve cutter
  - a flexible pair of rails, with a sliding crosspiece guide a powertool to cut a curve.  the rails are suspended from a pair of parallel vertical plates with a series of vertical slots.  the flexible rails are attached to the vertical plates with a series of knobs that can be tightened onto the plates. the tightened knobs act like the specified veritices on a curve in inkscape, they define exactly where certain points are, but the shape of the curve is 'automatically filled in'. You just set several key points, and the curve is created by the flexibility of the rail. 
- Qs
  - How could you create a negative from a positive with a machine?  an 'anti-copy-carver'?
  - [Thermal cycling and impurities theorized to make damascus/wootz steel contain carbon nanotubes and nanowires](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/03/damascus-blacksmiths-had-made-steel-blades-with-carbon-nanotubes-long-before-they-were-scientifically-discovered/) Could an automated furnace robot do this thermal cycling process automatically?
