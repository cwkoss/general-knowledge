### What's this colony thing
- I want to buy a bunch of land in the middle of nowhere, build a bunch of housing, recreational and light industry structures, farm plants and animals, develop technology, educate and do science.  Over time the colony will strive towards minimizing imports and maximizing exports.  Citizens will be able to join and leave, and their voting power will be proportional to their stake in the colony.  Citizens can earn stake by contributing assets, working for the colony, or return on investment of their stake in colony projects.  The colony should strive for these principles:
  - self-supporting 
    - all consumed food and materials can be produced on-site
  - self-sustaining 
    - assets should accumulate over time
  - self-replicating 
    - all systems should be modular and easy to copy, colony could be subdivided or recreated in different locations with different rules adapting to differences in citizens, environment and assets
  - resilient
    - redundancy, surplus, guard rails, and wide safety margins are encouraged to provide protection from risks
  - educating
      - an educational and scientific resource for citizens and outsiders to learn what we've done and how to do it again, and gain an understanding of how inputs vary outputs
  - abundant
    - produces a surplus of food, technology, and educational resources to serve and transact with the outside community
  - verdant
    - the ecology of the colony should provide a net increase in fertility of its land over time

### Why make a colony
- Our society and government suck in some really systemic ways which I'm not sure will be able to be remedied within my lifetime.  Change from within is slow, expensive and faces much resistance.  By creating our own government-within-the-government, we can have more flexible rules, faster iteration times, and experiment more easily.  Agile software development for goverment, culture and lifestyle.  I believe wide-scale centralization is responsible for a lot of our economic and social ills.  As more layers of buraeucracy are added, and each takes its cut, progress is slowed and less income remains for labor.  As beaurocracy requirement is proportional to scale, staying small minimizes this cost.
By creating a small replicable opt-in society, hopefully many other colonies with similar principles will appear.  Citizens will be able to travel between colonies, be citizens of multiple colonys, and join or leave the whole system at will.  This gives citizens not only the ability to change their society with their votes, but to literally change which society they live in by moving to a different one.  I think this sort of decentralized community-scale opt-in govermental system is humanity's best path towards a utopian future.  Probably kind of farfetched though.
